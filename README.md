# Cars API
A simple cars API with functionality for adding cars, rating them and reviewing their popularity

 - Built using Django 3.1
 - Works with SQLite database
 
Before running the server, please create a key.py file in /cars_api directory with the following content:
SECRET_KEY = 'whatever'
(I had to remove it from the settings.py due to GitGuardian policy break detection)
